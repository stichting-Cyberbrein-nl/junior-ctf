## Getting Started

### 1. Game Structure
The game is divided into three main components:
- **Encryption Lessons**: Learn about different encryption methods
- **Quizzes**: Test your knowledge
- **Code Challenges**: Practice your skills with real encryption puzzles

### 2. Navigation
- Use the main menu to access different sections
- Progress through lessons in order
- Complete quizzes to unlock new challenges
- Track your progress in the leaderboard

## Learning Path

### 1. Encryption Lessons
Start with the basic lessons:
1. "Wat is geheimschrift?" (What is cryptography?)
2. "Geheime sleutels" (Secret keys)
3. Progress to more advanced topics

### 2. Quizzes
- Take quizzes after completing lessons
- Minimum passing score: 7/10
- Review explanations for incorrect answers
- Earn flags for completing quizzes

### 3. Code Challenges
Practice with codes of increasing difficulty:
- Easy: Caesar Cipher, ROT13, Atbash
- Medium: Vigenère, Affine, Base64
- Hard: Binary, Hexadecimal, Advanced Base64

## Tips for Success

### 1. Learning Strategies
